    "**Anomaly Detection** is an interesting modeling algorithm that can be used to identify rare cases (such as fraud detection). It is normally considered as an unsupervised learning technique. From personal experiecne, I've also appied it for skewed binary classifications and achieved reasonable reasults. Let's now get to the algorithm itself."
