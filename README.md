# Machine Learning Algorithms In Python From Ground Up\n\n**Please note that the equations might not render properly with Firefox in Linux. We recommend using Chrome to view all the Jupyter/Ipython notebooks. This is a known issue mentioned [here](https://github.com/jupyter/nbviewer/issues/452), and we will inform if any update is available.**\n\nThis repository aims to code basic machine learning algorithms from scratch, providing a deeper understanding of supervised and unsupervised learning tools. We go beyond using packaged models and delve into the data science methods that power them.  \n\nThis repository includes Python codes for the following algorithms:\n - Linear Regression\n - Logistic Regression\n - Neural Networks\n - K-Nearest Neighbour Regression & Classification\n - Anomaly Detection\n - Principle Component Analysis\n\nThis work is partially inspired by materials and notes from [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).\n\nThe project dependencies include:\n - [numpy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html)\n - [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/)\n\nPlease feel free to get in touch with the new owner 'soithai' for any comments/suggestions.
